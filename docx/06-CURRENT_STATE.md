*This current state document reflects the substantial progress made on the Postgirl project. The complete multi-request tabbed interface system represents a major milestone, transforming Postgirl from a single-request tool to a powerful multi-request environment similar to browser tabs or IDE file tabs. Combined with the previously implemented automatic branch management and comprehensive environment system, Postgirl now offers a unique Git-first API testing experience that sets it apart from existing tools. The project is now well-positioned for import/export system completion and beta release preparation.*
