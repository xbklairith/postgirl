## Key Technical Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Framework Selection: **Tauri 2.0** (Changed from Electron)

**Rationale for Change:**
- **Performance**: ~20MB bundle vs ~150MB Electron
- **Memory**: ~50MB RAM vs ~200MB Electron
- **Security**: Rust memory safety, minimal attack surface
- **Native Integration**: Better OS integration and performance

**Impact on Development:**
- Rust backend development required
- Smaller development team can focus on performance-critical features
- Better security posture out of the box
- Reduced distribution size and resource usage

### ‚úÖ Core Architecture Confirmed

**Git-First Approach:**
- Every workspace = One Git repository
- No proprietary storage formats
- Complete data ownership for users
- Version control for all API testing assets

**Environment Consistency:**
- Schema-enforced variable consistency across ALL environments
- Type validation for environment variables
- Cross-environment change propagation
- Real-time validation and conflict detection

**Performance Targets:**
- <2s cold startup time (Tauri advantage)
- <50ms HTTP request overhead
- <100MB memory usage (typical workload)
- 60fps UI responsiveness
